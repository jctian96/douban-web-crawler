# douban-web-crawler
This is a web crawler program that scrapes movie information from www.douban.com, the most popular movie review website in China. You may choose the genre, production country, range of audience rating, etc. of the movies that you are interested in, and you may include other video forms including TV series, documentary, cartoon, etc. in your search as well. 

This result will include each film's title, user rating, number of rating people, directors, script writers, actors, genres, production countries and regions, languages, initial release date, other names, and IMdb link. 

The data obtained is well suited for many further analysis purposes. For example, some people might be interested in which films received the best ratings from the Chinese audience, and the result could be filtered by only including those movies reviewed by more than 100K people. Other analysis might include who are the best directors and actors, which countries' productions are consumed the most in China, how did the overall rating of Chinese domestically made movies evolve over the years... You decide. However, this program is just about obtaining the data rather than making analysis.
